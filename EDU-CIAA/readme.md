All the files related to EDU-CIAA using Eclipse (EDU-CIAA Launcher version), needs firmware-v3 files.

Here you can find statechart files (using Yakindu), its auto-generated code, and the main program using the state machine generated by Yakindu. This approach was abandoned after migrating everything to ESP32. The program has every requirement met, just have to fix the UART interrupt bug. Still better to use ESP32 only.
