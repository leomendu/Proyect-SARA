In this repository you can find all the files related to the S.A.R.A. Proyect, started for EDU-CIAA and continued for ESP32 (tested for ESP32-WROOM-32).

There are also some KiCAD files showing the schematic circuit of a functioning prototype made by recycled items. Soon there will also be a FreeCAD folder with the designs of the casings for the first two models: Oreo and Ene.
