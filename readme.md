In this repository you can find all the files related to the S.A.R.A. Proyect, started for EDU-CIAA and continued for ESP32 (tested for ESP32-WROOM-32).

There are also some KiCAD files showing the schematic circuit of a functioning prototype made by recycled items. 

Soon there will also be:
 - a FreeCAD folder with the designs of the casings for the first two models: Oreo and Ene.
 - a fully designed PCB inside KiCAD folder.
 - a MeawDetector file containing training of a Neural Network capable of detecting cat sounds for automatic activation.
 - an Android folder with all the files needed to compile a Kotlin Android App for connecting, managing and configuring S.A.R.A.
